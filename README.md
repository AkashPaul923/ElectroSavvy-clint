## Category : 02

It's a service-sharing web application designed to provide users with a seamless experience for managing and sharing services. This platform allows users to perform key actions such as adding, updating, and deleting their own services, browsing services shared by others, booking services, and managing the statuses of booked services. My focus during development was on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface to ensure smooth navigation and efficient service management for all users.
